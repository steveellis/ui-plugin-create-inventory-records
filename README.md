## Introduction

This package furnishes a single Stripes plugin of type `create-inventory-records`,
which can be included in Stripes modules by means of a `<Pluggable
type="create-inventory-records">` element. See [the *Plugins*
section](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core/blob/master/doc/dev-guide.md#plugins)
of the Module Developer's Guide.

## Props

The following props can be passed to the `Pluggable` component. They will be passed through to this plugin.

| prop | type | description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `onClose` | Object: `{ instanceRecord, holdingsRecord, itemRecord }` | Function called upon closing the modal. If the close is the result of a successful record creation, then an object will be passed that contains info about the created records. |
| `open` | boolean | When true, this plugin will render the record-creation modal. |
| `renderTrigger` | Function: `({ id, onClick }) => <YourButton />` | A render-function that is passed a props object and returns JSX. Used to customize the rendering of a trigger to open the record-creation modal. |
